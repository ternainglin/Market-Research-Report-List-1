<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wired Aviation Headset Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) Headsets</li><li>Active Noise Reduction (ANR) Headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wired aviation headset market offers two primary types: Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) headsets and Active Noise Reduction (ANR) headsets. PNR headsets utilize physical materials and design to block external noise, providing a basic level of sound isolation. In contrast, ANR headsets employ advanced technology to actively counteract ambient noise through sound wave interference, resulting in a significantly quieter environment. Both styles aim to enhance communication and comfort for pilots and aviation professionals, but ANR headsets typically offer superior noise management.</p></p>
