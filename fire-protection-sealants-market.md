<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type Sealants</li><li>Intumescent Type Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire protection sealants market primarily features two types: elastometric and intumescent sealants. Elastometric sealants are flexible, capable of expanding and contracting with building materials, thus providing a durable barrier against smoke and fire. In contrast, intumescent sealants react to high temperatures by expanding, forming a thick insulating char that helps to block flames and heat. Both types are crucial for maintaining fire-resistant seals in building assemblies, ensuring safety and compliance with fire regulations.</p></p>
