<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Turbidity Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scattered Light Turbidimeter</li><li>Transmitted Light Turbidimeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable turbidity analyzer market features two primary types: scattered light turbidimeters and transmitted light turbidimeters. Scattered light turbidimeters measure turbidity by detecting light scattered at various angles as it passes through a sample, making them effective for low turbidity levels. In contrast, transmitted light turbidimeters measure the light that passes directly through a sample, providing accurate readings for higher turbidity levels. Both types serve crucial roles in water quality monitoring across industries, enhancing environmental assessments and regulatory compliance.</p></p>
