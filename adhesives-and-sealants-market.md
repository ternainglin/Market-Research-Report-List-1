<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The adhesives and sealants market features different types of dental adhesives: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching adhesives. Self-etching adhesives combine etching and bonding in one step, simplifying application and reducing technique sensitivity. Selective-etching adhesives use an acid etch on enamel only, preserving dentin's bond strength while maximizing enamel adhesion. Total-etching adhesives require separate etching of both enamel and dentin, offering strong bonding but necessitating meticulous application. These variations cater to diverse dental needs and techniques, enhancing clinical outcomes.</p></p>
