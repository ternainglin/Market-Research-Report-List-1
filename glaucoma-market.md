<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Glaucoma Surgeries</li><li>Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgeries</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glaucoma market is divided into two primary types: Conventional Glaucoma Surgeries and Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgeries (MIGS). Conventional surgeries, such as trabeculectomy, involve more invasive techniques to create drainage channels for intraocular fluid, often requiring longer recovery times. In contrast, MIGS procedures utilize advanced technology to reduce intraocular pressure with less trauma to the eye, leading to quicker recovery and fewer complications. Both approaches aim to manage glaucoma effectively, but they cater to different patient needs and severity levels.</p></p>
